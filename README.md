![LEGO Textures](https://raw.github.com/rioforce/LEGO-Textures/master/header.png)
===========================

These LEGO textures are scanned from real LEGO bricks! These textures are in an Inkscape .SVG format, so they are easily scalable to fit any texture UV map! (They also come in .PNG format if you don't use .SVGs.)

Instructions
============

The textures are in the "Complete" folder as SVG files. They are sorted by category. 
* Select a category folder.
* Textures are in .SVG and .PNG format. (The .SVG is the original vector graphic, while the .PNG is already a an image).
* Download the file of your choice.
* Use it in your project.
