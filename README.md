![LEGO Textures](https://raw.github.com/rioforce/LEGO-Textures/master/header.png)
===========================

These LEGO textures are scanned from real LEGO bricks! You can use these textures in anything you would like! They are 
free too! These textures are in an Inkscape .SVG format, so they are easily scalable to fit any texture UV map!
Whether you want to use them in 3D art, photoshopping, or just plain anything, you can!

Instructions
============

The textures are in the "Complete" folder as SVG files. They are sorted by category. 
* Select a category folder.
* Textures are in .SVG format. Some files are .PNG files. Those are already converted. They are most likely in 1024x1024 resolution. It is recommended that you download the original .SVG files instead.
* Open s .SVG file in Inkscape (or if you know how to use another SVG program you can).
* Go to File>Export Bitmap
* Under "Export Area", select Page.
* Set the dimensions you want your PNG file to be.
* Export and locate your file.
* Now you can open the PNG file in any image editor to fit it to your UV Map (that is, if you plan to use these for 3D renders)

Notes
=====

In the root of the repository, you will see a "PNGs" folder. This folder contains the original scans of the textures. They are NOT production quality. Please use the textures out of the "Complete" colder instead.

Support
=======

If you need any help, want to request some refinement on a texture, or want to request a specific texture, just summit a "bug" here:

https://github.com/rioforce/LEGO-Textures/issues/new

NOTE: I cannot do all textures requested, for various reasons such as:
* I do not own the minifigure
* I cannot find a good-quality photo online to use.
