LEGO Textures
=============

These LEGO textures are scanned from real LEGO bricks! You can use these textures in anything you would like! They are 
free too! These textures are in an Inkscape .SVG format, so they are easily scalable to fit any texture UV map!
Whether you want to use them in 3D art, photoshopping, or just plain anything, you can!

Instructions
============

The textures are in the "Completed" folder as SVG files. 
* Download a file
* Open them in Inkscape (or if you know how to use another SVG program you can).
* Go to File>Export Bitmap
* Under "Export Area", select Page.
* Set the demensions you want your PNG file to be.
* Export and locate your file.
* Now you can open the PNG file in any image editor to fit it to your UV Map (that is, if you plan to use these for 3D renders)

The "PNGs" folder has all of my original scans in it that I have already cropped. Most (if not all) of them are already converted to SVG.
